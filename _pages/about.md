Now I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the School of Mathematics and Computational Science, Xiangtan University (XTU). I obtained my master's degree at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Chongqing University (CQU), under the supervision of Prof. [Hanyu Li](https://faculty.cqu.edu.cn/HanyuLi/zh_CN/index.htm), and obtained my PhD degree at the School of Mathematical Science, Peking University (PKU), under the supervision of Prof. [Chao Yang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yangch/english/index.html). After that, I did postdoctoral research at PKU.

Research Interest
======
I am interested in (randomized) numerical linear algebra, tensor computation and applications, tensor networks, model reduction, and parallel computing. Particularly,
* (Randomized) numerical linear algebra: matrix perturbation analysis, randomized algorithms in NLA;
* Tensor computation: algorithms for tensor operators such as tensor decomposition, recompression, and so on;
* Tensor application: tensors in scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and data science.
